# project (Traceable Academic Research Code Repo)
This repo archives all source code in my academic research pathway, basically accomplished in a certain academic authority (e.g. univiersity), along with some published papers. 
This repo will update by `crontab` daily, on the condition that there is any modification (and my staying in academia).

We believe in the value of traceable and open-source scientific research. 
Besides, the separation of **data itself** and **processing operations on data** can benefit post-disaster reconstruction of your knowledge library. 

Feel free to use our scripts!

Any question, please contact Zhenning LI: zhenningli91@gmail.com

Cooperated.
