# project (Traceable Academic Research Code Repo)
This repo archives all source code in my academic research pathway, basically accomplished in a certain academic authority (e.g. univiersity), along with some published papers. 
This repo will update by `crontab` daily, on the condition that there is any modification (and my staying in academia).

We believe in the value of traceable and open-source scientific research. 
Besides, the separation of **data itself** and **processing operations on data** can benefit post-disaster reconstruction of your knowledge library. 

Feel free to use our scripts!

Any question, please contact Zhenning LI: zhenningli91@gmail.com

## 1810-ENSO-BIAS
Cooperated. Intended to deal with ENSO bias over the tropical Pacific Ocean. Some scripts are archived to deal with the pre-processing procedures for [Heat Flux correction in the fully coupled CESM](https://novarizark.github.io/2018/10/29/cesm-fully-coupled-correction/).

## 1911-yeq-HALOGEN
Cooperated. Intended to work on the CMAQ Halogen simulation, but finally focused on Effect of bromine and iodine chemistry, relevant paper: [Effect of bromine and iodine chemistry on tropospheric ozone over Asia-Pacific using the CMAQ model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653520317902).

## 1809-ANTARCTICA
**Obsolete** Heating experiments set in matrix over the tropical region focused on Polar Responses. (Suggested by Prof. Song Yang)
