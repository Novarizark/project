# project (Traceable Academic Research Code Repo)
This repo archives all source code in my academic research pathway, basically accomplished in a certain academic authority (e.g. univiersity), along with some published papers. 
This repo will update by `crontab` daily, on the condition that there is any modification (and my staying in academia).

We believe in the value of traceable and open-source scientific research. 
Besides, the separation of **data itself** and **processing operations on data** can benefit post-disaster reconstruction of your knowledge library. 

Feel free to use our scripts!

Any question, please contact Zhenning LI: zhenningli91@gmail.com

## 1810-ENSO-BIAS
Cooperated. Intended to deal with ENSO bias over the tropical Pacific Ocean. Some scripts are archived to deal with the pre-processing procedures for [Heat Flux correction in the fully coupled CESM](https://novarizark.github.io/2018/10/29/cesm-fully-coupled-correction/).

## 1911-yeq-HALOGEN
Cooperated. Intended to work on the CMAQ Halogen simulation, but finally focused on Effect of bromine and iodine chemistry, relevant paper: [Effect of bromine and iodine chemistry on tropospheric ozone over Asia-Pacific using the CMAQ model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653520317902).

## 1905-GD-LSTM-FORECAST
Initial test scripts for [SpellCaster!](https://github.com/Novarizark/spellcaster-local), a machine learning algorithm based, monthly anomaly prediction experiment, forcusing on temperature and precipitation anomalies in each individual weather station in China.
Spellcaster is extended to the whole China domain now. realtime forecast result can be found on the [Github page](https://novarizark.github.io/Side%20Projects/).

## 1809-ANTARCTICA
**Obsolete** Heating experiments set in matrix over the tropical region focused on Polar Responses. (Suggested by Prof. Song Yang) 

## 1810-MODEL-PRESENTATION
Jupyter Notebook with illustrutive of model integration.

## 1901-TAX
Calculate the income cashflow for graduate student after tax law reformation. The [related article](https://novarizark.github.io/2019/01/25/new-tax-system-student-stipend/) is archived (in Chinese).
